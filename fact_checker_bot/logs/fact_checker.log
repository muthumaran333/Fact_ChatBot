But this region isn’t governed like one city. It’s a patchwork of rival cities — Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad — all fighting for power, but sharing the same roads, air, and problems. From unplanned urban growth, traffic gridlock, and toxic pollution, to a metro system that doesn’t fully connect and water wars between states, this video unpacks why Delhi is falling apart and what that means for India's future.\n\nWith a broken infrastructure, fragmented governance, and an overstrained economy, the NCR is a microcosm of the larger issues facing India's urban centers. From Gurugram’s privatized urban jungle to Delhi’s sprawling mess of political and economic power struggles, the chaos is palpable. Watch as we dive into the unique challenges of Delhi's rapid growth and explore what happens when a capital city is too fractured to function.\n\nDelhi’s journey from an imperial capital to a hyper-modern megacity with no clear leadership is a story of ambition, division, and resilience. This video explores the complexities of India’s capital and the forces that are shaping its chaotic future.\n\nMusic:\n\nThe song East of Tunesia by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100246\n\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nAakash Gandhi - Palace of Roses\nSandeep Das, Mayank Raina, Bivakar Chaudhuri - Raag Pahadi\nSandeep Das, Amrendra Mishra - Raag Charukeshi Madhyalaya Teentaal (Sitar, Tabla) \n\nImportant to note that this video is for entertainment purposes only.
